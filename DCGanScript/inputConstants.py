# Inputs
# ------
# 
# Let’s define some inputs for the run:
# 
# -  **dataroot** - the path to the root of the dataset folder. We will
#    talk more about the dataset in the next section
# -  **workers** - the number of worker threads for loading the data with
#    the DataLoader
# -  **batch_size** - the batch size used in training. The DCGAN paper
#    uses a batch size of 128
# -  **image_size** - the spatial size of the images used for training.
#    This implementation defaults to 64x64. If another size is desired,
#    the structures of D and G must be changed. See
#    `here <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/issues/70>`__ for more
#    details
# -  **nc** - number of color channels in the input images. For color
#    images this is 3
# -  **nz** - length of latent vector
# -  **ngf** - relates to the depth of feature maps carried through the
#    generator
# -  **ndf** - sets the depth of feature maps propagated through the
#    discriminator
# -  **num_epochs** - number of training epochs to run. Training for
#    longer will probably lead to better results but will also take much
#    longer
# -  **lr** - learning rate for training. As described in the DCGAN paper,
#    this number should be 0.0002
# -  **beta1** - beta1 hyperparameter for Adam optimizers. As described in
#    paper, this number should be 0.5
# -  **ngpu** - number of GPUs available. If this is 0, code will run in
#    CPU mode. If this number is greater than 0 it will run on that number
#    of GPUs
#
