# Discriminator
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# As mentioned, the discriminator, $D$, is a binary classification
# network that takes an image as input and outputs a scalar probability
# that the input image is real (as opposed to fake). Here, $D$ takes
# a 3x64x64 input image, processes it through a series of Conv2d,
# BatchNorm2d, and LeakyReLU layers, and outputs the final probability
# through a Sigmoid activation function. This architecture can be extended
# with more layers if necessary for the problem, but there is significance
# to the use of the strided convolution, BatchNorm, and LeakyReLUs. The
# DCGAN paper mentions it is a good practice to use strided convolution
# rather than pooling to downsample because it lets the network learn its
# own pooling function. Also batch norm and leaky relu functions promote
# healthy gradient flow which is critical for the learning process of both
# $G$ and $D$.
